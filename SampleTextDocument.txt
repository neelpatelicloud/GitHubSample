The RCMP in Alberta are asking for tips from the public as they look for a family of three that has not been seen since Dec. 23.

In a news release issued late Monday, police said investigators believe the Pelsma family may have gone off-roading in utility terrain vehicle, or “side-by-side,” in Lac Ste. Anne County, which is located about a one-hour drive west of Edmonton.

“Parkland RCMP are concerned for their well-being and are asking for the public’s assistance,” police said in a news release. “Their intended destination was unknown.”
